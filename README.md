## Introduction
This repository includes a c++ implementation of GMPHD-GMMA.

All source codes are written in Visual C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10 x64.

OpenCV 3.4.1 and boost 1.61 ared used to implement the propsed tracker GMPHD-GMMA.

We will update an user guide of this project soon.

## Use guide
We have been preparing it.
