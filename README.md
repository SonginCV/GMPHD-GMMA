# GMPHD-GMMA
The GMPHD filter based Online Multiple Object Tracker using Group Management and Relative Motion Analysis

## Introduction
This repository includes an implementation of GMPHD-GMMA

in Visual C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10 x64.

#### Libraries
[OpenCV 3.4.1](https://www.opencv.org/opencv-3-4-1.html) and 
[boost 1.61.0 (Windows Binaries)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.61.0/) 
were used to implement the proposed GMPHD-GMMA tracker.

## User guide
We are working on it

### Input
Image Sequence & Detection Response

### Output
Tracking Results Files
