## Introduction
This repository includes a c++ implementation of GMPHD-GMMA.

All source codes are written in Visual C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10 x64.

OpenCV 3.4.1 (https://www.opencv.org/opencv-3-4-1.html) and boost 1.61.0 (https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_61_0.html) are used to implement the proposed GMPHD-GMMA tracker.

## GMPHD-GMMA
